Hi, my name is Edson Carlos! 😁

• I have approximately 2 years of experience as a DevOps Analyst and Solutions Architect, in which I can highlight the following tasks performed: Implementation of CI/CD processes, creation of scripts for the automation of pipeline templates, customized creation of dashboards in Grafana for observability and monitoring, resolution of problems in critical environments, and others. 

• Also, I have worked on various projects that allowed me to learn and use several technologies, including AWS, GCP, Azure, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Gitlab, Grafana, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Shell Script, Python, and Linux. I already got the CKA certification! The next will be CKAD 💪
