Hey there! I'm a DevOps Engineer and a student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, currently studying Computational Physics. I absolutely love technology and am always excited to learn new things and take on challenges. When I'm not geeking out, you can usually find me going for a run or staying active in some way. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge in the DevOps field. I'm proud to be Brazilian!
